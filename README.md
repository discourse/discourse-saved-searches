## discourse-saved-searches

This plugin allows users to save searches and receive notifications when
new posts match those searches.

## Installation

Proceed with a normal [installation of a plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157).

## After Installation

Enable the plugin by going to the settings in Admin. Find the "saved searches enabled" setting and enable it.

You can also restrict saved searches based on user trust level by changing the "saved searches min trust level" setting.
For example, you can make saved searches a reward for achieving trust level 2.

## About

In your user preferences, there will be a new section called "Saved Searches".
In each input field, you can save some seach terms like you would in Discourse's search input.
Once a day, these searches will be run. If any new results are found, you'll receive a private
system message with links to the posts that match your search terms.
You won't be notified of any posts that you've already seen.
